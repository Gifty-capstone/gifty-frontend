## Description

 - This was the capstone project for the [Turing School of Software and Design](www.turing.edu).  We worked in a team of front and back end engineers to complete a full stack application over the course of two weeks.

 - Our team utilized Agile methodologies and a git rebase workflow to collaborate on Gifty, an application to keep track of dates and gift ideas for friends' birthdays.
